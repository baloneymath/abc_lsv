Notations:
  - f : the merged node
  - g : the node which merges f
  - N : original network
  - N': duplicated network

  To find all the 1-sub pairs, first we iterate through all the Aig nodes and
check each PI and other Aig nodes, and replace f by g on the duplicated network,
then we apply random simulation to both the original network and the duplicated
one, and check if all the PO values are the same. If exists a conflict, then it
means that the two networks are not the same, which implies that g is not a 
1sub candidate of f.
  Second, if pass simulation, we make a Miter of the two networks, and then use
"Fraiging + Rewriting + Sat Solver" to prove the Miter, and check if the two 
networks are the same. If the two networks are the same, then g is a 1-sub
candidate of f.
